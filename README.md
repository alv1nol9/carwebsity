This is a website for a car dealership along valley road called valley road motors 
i am extremely proud of my self for putting in the time to do this and overall it has increased my knowledge as a junior dev about how the backend and frontend work together.
The whole project is purely javascript and react
And a lot of css(i hate css)

Thank You
